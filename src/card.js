            para: "Efficient transportation has always been the cornerstone of national progress. In recent years, the advent of large-scale driving datasets capable of managing myriad tasks within Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) has become indispensable. However, existing datasets fall short in two crucial areas: they do not address the diverse vehicle types prevalent in developing economies like India, nor do they facilitate real-world applications of videos and images captured from static camera setups. To bridge this gap, we present the Indian Traffic Dataset (ITD), meticulously developed to capture the rich tapestry of India's traffic, featuring an eclectic mix of vehicles from various regions across the country. What sets ITD apart is its comprehensive labeling of vehicle classes according to the Indian Highway Capacity Manual (INDO-HCM), making it unparalleled among existing datasets. This classification system is particularly relevant for other South and Southeast Asian countries, where the traffic landscape includes a plethora of auto-rickshaws, electric rickshaws, motorized two-wheelers, and more. The ITD comprises an impressive 17,666 annotated images, with 7,778 of these being novel, spanning nine distinct classes and aggregating nearly 341,000 annotated objects. <br />The robustness of the ITD is evident in its validation, showing no significant difference between observed and predicted traffic volume counts at a 5% level of significance. It encapsulates a wide array of traffic conditions, from structured to unstructured road environments, enabling versatile task handling such as vehicle counting and traffic flow analysis. Moreover, its applicability extends to trajectory analysis, safety assessments, and traffic violation detection, making it an invaluable resource for a multitude of ITS applications.",
