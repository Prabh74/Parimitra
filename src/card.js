            para: "Efficient transportation is essential for national progress. Modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) rely on large-scale driving datasets, but existing datasets fall short in addressing the diverse vehicle types found in developing economies like India and in utilizing real-world video and image data from static cameras. To bridge this gap, we present the Indian Traffic Dataset (ITD). <br /> <br />The ITD captures the diverse traffic of India, featuring a variety of vehicles from different regions. It includes 17,666 annotated images, 7,778 of which are novel, spanning nine distinct classes and nearly 341,000 annotated objects. Unique to ITD is the comprehensive labeling of vehicle classes according to the Indian Highway Capacity Manual (INDO-HCM), making it especially relevant for South and Southeast Asian countries with similar traffic landscapes. <br /> <br />Validated with no significant difference between observed and predicted traffic volumes at a 5% significance level, the ITD covers a wide range of traffic conditions. It supports tasks such as vehicle counting, traffic flow analysis, trajectory analysis, safety assessments, and traffic violation detection, making it an invaluable resource for various ITS applications.",
